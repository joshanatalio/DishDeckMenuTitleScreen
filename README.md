DishDeckMenuTitleScreen
=======================

We made this application for CSE110 at UCSD during Spring Quarter 2014. The application we made is called Dine, it is an iOS
restuarant assistant designed for iOS 7. The application helps you find delicious foods by presenting the menu items in a
visually satisfying way.We integrated many UI elements that would enhance the overall user experience and allow the users 
to use our app in unison with the restaurant. In regards to restuarant integration, the application will support any restaurant
who would agree to parnter with our application and provide us with a complete menu, including images, food descriptions, and 
food prices. For demonstration purposes, our app only supports BJ's, this is because our group had to populate and input the
data by hand, so we placed functionality and design over variety. 

Dine also integrates iBeacon technology and uses low energy bluetooth to help integrate a "queue" system that 
allows users to put their information onto the restaurant waiting list via our application. This cannot be easily tested,
however you can simulate iBeacon frequencies from newer MacBook Pros(2011 and later). This technology would also have to be
managed by the restaurant but would be fairly simple integrate. 

iBeacons can recognize when users are in close proximity to the restaurant and prompt the user wether or not they want to
be added to the queue. This can save users time and they can even check their waiting list position if they leave the 
proximity of the restaurant, allowing users to shop nearby with a good sense of how much time they have until a table is
ready for them.

We do not own any of the restuarant logos, menu items, or trademark names. All these things are owneed by their repsecive
restaurants.
